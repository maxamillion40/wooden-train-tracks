===================

Templates for a variety of wooden train track shapes that can be laser cut out of 1/8 inch cardboard.

My son likes wooden train tracks and trains, of the sort you can buy from Ikea, or Brio, or Thomas, or what have you. We are moving to Europe and it costs $16 a cubic foot to move household items like toys. I propose to get rid of our large box O' tracks, develop designs for laser cutting them out of cardboard, and then re-supply him with newly cut tracks on the other side of the pond. Y'all can cut your own tracks for folks without funds to buy the real fancy wooden ones! (And maybe even make some weirdly improbably shaped tracks, which ought to be fun too!)

My Inkscape-Fu is weak as yet. Please add in your own designs here and send PRs.
I'm thinking a collection of many individual tracks, and perhaps a single "all tracks" file that can easily be cut from an 32" x 18" sheet of cardboard should do nicely.
